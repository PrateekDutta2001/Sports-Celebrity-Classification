# Sports-Celebrity-Classification

With the exponential growth of the presence of sport in the media, the need for effective classification of sports celebrity has become crucial. The traditional approaches require carefully hand-crafted features, which make them impractical for massive-scale data and less accurate in distinguishing images that are very similar in appearance. As the deep learning methods can automatically extract deep representation of training data and have achieved impressive
performance in image classification

A huge increase of the amount of non-textual information available in electronic form in mass media requires dealing with it as a major source of content [1]. Digital archiving and multimedia analysis are needed to improve the processing efficiency of this material. Specifically, multimedia intelligent systems count on effective classification and indexing of multimedia (e.g., images and videos) in various domains, including sports. The presence of sports in the media has grown exponentially over the last few decades [2], as the broadcasters produce enormous numbers of sports content in cyberspace due to massive viewership and commercial benefits [3]. To deal with such an amount of information, computational intelligence methods are increasingly used in sports [4]. 

Image classification, as one of the enabling techniques for effective manipulation over large-scale images and videos, is challenging [5]. The intent of the classification process is to decide whether an image belongs to a certain category. Traditional algorithms for sports image classification require carefully hand-crafted features, such as color, texture, object shape, and contour [6]. Notwithstanding the fact that this kind of use is very impractical due to the emergence of massive-scale data, such algorithms have the most difficulty in distinguishing sports disciplines that are very similar in appearance

The use of image classification methods and techniques in sports is not new. Previous works on image and video classification for sports related content can be generally divided into traditional ML algorithms and the more recently developed DL techniques. In current work, Sequencial Convolutional Nueral Network has been applied on the data for classification with 40 equal epochs. Relu was used as an activation function & Adam as an optimizer and further on acheiving measurable result, Accuracy v/s Loss curve has been plotted.

Data is in image type of .jpg format. Five classes were there containg image of five different sports celebrity. 'Kane Williamson', 'Kobe Bryant', 'MS Dhoni', 'Maria Sharapova', 'Ronaldo'. In conclusion, the main contribution and purpose of the proposed method is to provide a robust and automatic approach, which then significantly improves the classification performance.
