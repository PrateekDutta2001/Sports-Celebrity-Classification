# Sports-Celebrity-Classification

With the exponential growth of the presence of sport in the media, the need for effective classification of sports celebrity has become crucial. The traditional approaches require carefully hand-crafted features, which make them impractical for massive-scale data and less accurate in distinguishing images that are very similar in appearance. As the deep learning methods can automatically extract deep representation of training data and have achieved impressive
performance in image classification

A huge increase of the amount of non-textual information available in electronic form in mass media requires dealing with it as a major source of content [1]. Digital archiving and multimedia analysis are needed to improve the processing efficiency of this material. Specifically, multimedia intelligent systems count on effective classification and indexing of multimedia (e.g., images and videos) in various domains, including sports. The presence of sports in the media has grown exponentially over the last few decades [2], as the broadcasters produce enormous numbers of sports content in cyberspace due to massive viewership and commercial benefits [3]. To deal with such an amount of information, computational intelligence methods are increasingly used in sports [4]. 

Image classification, as one of the enabling techniques for effective manipulation over large-scale images and videos, is challenging [5]. The intent of the classification process is to decide whether an image belongs to a certain category. Traditional algorithms for sports image classification require carefully hand-crafted features, such as color, texture, object shape, and contour [6]. Notwithstanding the fact that this kind of use is very impractical due to the emergence of massive-scale data, such algorithms have the most difficulty in distinguishing sports disciplines that are very similar in appearance
